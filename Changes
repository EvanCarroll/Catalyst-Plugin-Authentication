Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication

0.10003 2007-XX-XX
        - Added a "Null" store for credentials that don't require real stores.
        - Make realms bonafide objects
        - Added auto_update_user and auto_create_user options to the Realm object
        - Doc updates

        [POSSIBLE INCOMPATIBILITIES]
        - authenticate() in credentials are now passed a realm object instead of
          a store object. A realm object still implements find_user() so unless
          you're doing something special you won't notice the difference.

0.10002 2007-07-22
        - $user->store() should NOT be set by C::P::Auth - if it's needed - it
          should be set by whatever module creates the user. We use realm for
          saving into the session.
