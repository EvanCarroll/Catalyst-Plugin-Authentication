## REQUIRED.
## get should return the value of the field specified as it's single argument from the underlying
## user object.  This is here to provide a simple, standard way of accessing individual elements of a user
## object - ensuring no overlap between C::P::A::User methods and actual fieldnames.
## this is not the most effecient method, since it uses introspection.  If you have an underlying object
## you most likely want to write this yourself.

    }
}

## REQUIRED.
## get_object should return the underlying user object.  This is for when more advanced uses of the 
## user is required.  Modifications to the existing user, etc.  Changes in the object returned
## by this routine may not be reflected in the C::P::A::User object - if this is required, re-authenticating
## the user is probably the best route to take.
## note that it is perfectly acceptable to return $self in cases where there is no underlying object.
sub get_object {
    return shift;

## Backwards Compatibility
## you probably want auth_realm, in fact.  but this does work for backwards compatibility.
## store should be a read-write accessor - so it was moved to mk_accessors
##sub store { 
##    my ($self) = @_;
##    return $self->auth_realm->{store};
